## Overview
This project aims to optimize the storage of video footage from CCTV cameras. Our estimates showed that around 24 terabytes  of storage would be required to store a year's worth of footage from a CCTV camera recording 24 hours a day at 1080p. To address this, we've developed a system that senses the presence of human activity and automatically starts recording. As soon as the activity is paused, the video also gets paused automatically, and the video recording of the session is downloaded.

Our tech stack includes Next.js, ChadCn UI, and TensorFlow, and we will be deploying it on Vercel.
